**PetpetGo App: Connecting Stray Animals with Loving Homes**

PetpetGo is a user-friendly application designed to facilitate the adoption process for stray animals in need of a home. Our goal is to connect shelters with potential adopters by providing a platform where shelters can upload detailed information about animals, and users can easily find and adopt their new companions.

Key Features:
Home Page:
•    The home page serves as an introduction to the shelters, offering essential information for users to learn more about each facility.
•    Shelters can manage their profiles, edit information, and publish contact details and addresses.
Search Page:
•    The search page empowers users to find their ideal pets through various filters and a search box for more specific queries.
•    Users can explore a diverse range of animals available for adoption.
User Personal Page:
•    This page is dedicated to individual users, providing them with a personalized space.
•    Users can edit their information, view their saved favorites, access help and settings, and log out if needed.
Registration and Login:
•    For users without an account, we offer a seamless registration process.
•    The login page ensures secure access for returning users.
PetpetGo aims to streamline the adoption experience, making it easier for both shelters and users to connect. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these deserving animals.
